# flask-trigger-detection
Flask based web application that detects the presence of triggering content in a given long document.

I coded the Hierarchical Recurrence concept over HuggingFace's transformer-based encoder in Pytorch. The details of the implementation and method can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14912).
